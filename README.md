Me: can fungi and mycelium can reduce GES

App:Problem: [e.g. humans are destroying nature, humans are not living in harmony with nature, etc.]

Why it's a problem: we need more biodiversity in city

Solution: growing mycelium 

How to implement the solution: with the community

Structure:

Introduce the problem

Describe the solution

Explain how to implement the solution


app: Humans are destroying nature and not living in harmony with it. This is a problem because we need more biodiversity in our cities, but we can't do that if the plants and animals are dying out due to climate change and pollution.

I believe that one solution to this problem is to grow mycelium. Mycelium is made up of microscopic threads called hyphae, which are similar to roots. The hyphae help plants grow by connecting them together and allowing them to absorb nutrients from the soil or water around them. Mycelium can also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into biomass, which means it helps plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air.

We can implement this solution by growing mycelium ourselves in our own homes, gardens, parks, etc. We can also work together as a community by working on projects like composting or collecting litter so that we can help reduce GES in our environment while also growing our own food!
