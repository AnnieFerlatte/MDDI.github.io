## Why Fabricademy
I discovered Fabricademy thanks to coworkers at échofab, Annie and François who participated in 2020. I am very lucky to be able to manage both my work load and enroll the Fabricademy. I'm very grateful and looking forward learning new techniques and play with the machines at the échofab lab. I'm very interested in circular fashion and experimenting with dyeing techniques. I wanted to push forward my practice of circular fashion, screenprinting on second hand garments, feeling like this is just the first step and there's so much more to discover in terms of upcycling unloved textiles.

## Previous work
#### Textile
